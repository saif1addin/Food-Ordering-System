🚀 Food Ordering Management System – A Team Project at FCIS 🍽️

As part of our second-year coursework at FCIS, my team and I developed a Food Ordering Management System featuring a sleek, user-friendly GUI built with Java.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance our programming, problem-solving, and GUI design skills while applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

🔹 Project Highlights
✅ Customer Features: Register, log in, create/update/cancel orders, explore restaurant options by area, and check order statuses.
✅ Admin Controls: Add, remove, and update restaurant details.
✅ Delivery Management: Delivery staff can view assigned orders.
✅ Organized Menus: Categories like Main Meals, Side Plates, Appetizers, and Drinks.
✅ File-Based Data Management: Exception handling ensures robust functionality.
